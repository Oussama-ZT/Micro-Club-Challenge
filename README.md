This code is for MicroClub challenge 
This activity is gonna be a sort of a mini ctf, basically you will form a team of 1 to 6 people max ( you can work alone ), 
you will have to make a website where you will have to leave at least 4 vulnerabilities or more, 
and you donâ€™t have to make the website look pretty the css is not important it's all about the vulnerabilities you will leave, 
then each team will get the website of another team and will have to find the vulnerabilities that they left
